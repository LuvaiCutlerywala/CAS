# CAS - A Computer Algebra System

## Introduction to CAS
Computer algebra systems, or CAS, are systems that can complete algebraic operations using a
computer. This includes things such as solving polynomials, approximating roots, linear
algebra, etc. These systems are used widely in physics and engineering, to calculate
simulation data, or to calculate different functions in terms of operations such as
integrals, derivatives, etc.

## Key Features

### Polynomials
- Ability to parse algebraic expressions, e.g. "x^2 + 2x + 1," and decompose them into  
polynomial objects.
- Solving linear, quadratic, cubic and quartic equations
- Approximating roots using the Newton-Raphson method

### Linear Algebra
- Ability to perform basic arithmetic with algebraic objects such as matrices and vectors.
- Ability to perform further operations on vectors, such as outer products, inner products, etc.
- Ability to perform further operations on matrices, such as finding the trace, determinant, inverse, etc.

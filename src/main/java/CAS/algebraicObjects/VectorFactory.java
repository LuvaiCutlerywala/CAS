/**
 * The grammar defined for the string representation of a vector is as follows:
 * (1, 2, 3, 4)
 * Where the initial set of brackets represents the vector matrix. The numbers themselves are the individual components
 * of the vector in that dimension. Therefore, the string representation, as given above, would yield a vector in the
 * form:
 *               1
 *               2
 *               3
 *               4
